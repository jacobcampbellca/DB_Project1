Developed using Apple 
IDE: xCode

No special steps needed to compile source code

Bugs
1) ‘f m’ command prints out cars by specific manufacturer, 
but does not print phone number of dealership where car
is being sold
2) ‘f z’ command print out cars being sold in specific ZIP code,
but does not print the manufacturer, miles, and price of each 
car

I approached this project by first finding sudo code to implement 
a linked list, as I initially thought this would be the easiest way 
to store the different data that was to be introduced. 
I then manipulated the initial code, and split it into 3 different 
lists to store information pertaining to the cars, dealerships, and 
manufacturers. When I reached the end, and had everything working 
besides the ‘f m’/f z’ commands, I came to the realization that I 
had approached the project all wrong and over complicated it to the 
point of being unable to get everything to work as it should. If i 
were to go back and do it again, I would not use linked lists as 
well as external files to store my data, and subsequently transfer 
the data back and forth. I would instead exclusively use external 
files to store data and read it in as needed.
